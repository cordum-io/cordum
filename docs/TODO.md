Approval hardening (prod‑grade)

- [x] Record approver identity + timestamp + reason (audit trail).
- [x] Bind approvals to policy snapshot + job hash (prevent replay after policy changes).
- [ ] Add expiry + revalidation on approval.
- [ ] Enforce RBAC/tenant scoping for approve/reject endpoints.
- [ ] Optional: quorum approvals for high‑risk topics.
