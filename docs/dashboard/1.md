# Dashboard UI (archived)

The dashboard UI has been removed from the platform-only repo.

- The control plane is operated via the API gateway and `coretexctl`.
- For live workflows and run inspection, use the HTTP APIs and WS stream.

If a UI is needed later, it should live in a separate package repository and consume the gateway APIs.
